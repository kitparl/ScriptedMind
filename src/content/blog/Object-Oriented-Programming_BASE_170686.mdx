There are many ways to write code, and it depends on the individual.

First, it's important to understand why programming styles matter. Everyone has their own ideas, ways of thinking, and methods of writing code. Similarly, in programming, each person can solve problems and implement solutions in their own way.

For example, if someone asks, What is Linux? you might hear different explanations:

- Linux is an open-source operating system similar to Windows but with many different versions.
- Linux is a generic term for a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
- Like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms, Android, is powered by Linux.
- Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix, known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

Each definition is correct but presents the information differently. Sometimes, it can be challenging to understand all the different styles people use.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), we work with classes and objects. A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.

For example, imagine you want to invent a car. First, you create a design or template for the car, which is like defining a class. Later, you can build specific cars with different features based on that design. In this case, the car design is like the class, and each specific car model, like a BMW, Audi or Maruti, represents an object.

Using OOP principles helps make code more reusable, modular, easier to debug, and gives you more control over your code.

When creating objects in object-oriented programming (OOP), we follow certain principles to ensure our code is effective and well-organized. These principles are Inhertance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.
