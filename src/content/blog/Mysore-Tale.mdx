title: Embracing Mysore Wonders

This was my second trip, and it was special because sometimes sudden plans are better than the organized ones.

## The Impromptu Adventure Begins

Actually, what happened was this: it was Saturday night, and I was chilling with my building friends. We went to Mr. Professor's shop, where we indulged in delicious Maggie and rice. By the time we finished, it was 2 o'clock in the morning. I was very confused about whether I should go to Mysore or not. My bike was ready, but my fickle mind was overwhelmed with indecision.

Finally, I decided to go. As I was packing my bag, I realized we had only one helmet. This isn't Lucknow, where you can drive with just one helmet. Nevertheless, we decided to go and purchase another one on the way. I chose Dipak as my trip buddy. Despite suffering from a fever, Dipak, in his own enigmatic way, was super excited to join me.

## The Enchantment of Hills on the Mysore Expressway

We started our trip, and I drove along the Mysore Expressway. As we traveled, I saw many small hills, and for some reason, I felt a deep sense of happiness upon seeing them. Being a mountain guy at heart, I had been confined to my room and office in Bangalore for the past year. These hills were mesmerizing me. In this fleeting life, where we never know how long we have or what the future holds, the hills seemed to be whispering, "Why are you missing out on beauty, my dear?" I found myself in a different mental space, pondering why these hills seemed to be speaking to me, whether it was my imagination or something more. Regardless, the feelings I experienced from the hills felt profoundly genuine.

## Navigating the Highway

I was driving at a maximum speed of 110 km per hour, with retardation. Mysore was still over 150 km away. I stopped at a petrol pump, where a 20-year-old guy warned me that the express highway was not meant for two-wheelers and that a hefty fine awaited anyone caught. He advised me to stop here as there were no road cut points ahead. Heeding his advice, I decided to switch to an alternate lane. We made a pit stop at a tea stall, where the pleasant break and hot tea added to our excitement for the journey ahead.

## A Quest for Rest

Finally, we reached Mysore. The time was 5 o'clock. We began searching for a place where we could stay for at least 3-4 hours. I started looking for a dharamshala, thinking it would be similar to those in North India, like Uttarakhand, where travelers can stay for free or at a minimal charge. This concept, designed specifically for long-distance travelers, used to be common in the past.

Eventually, we found a place that was labeled as a dharamshala, but there was no one around. A local informed us that the dharamshala concept didn’t exist here. We then turned our attention to hotels, but most were charging unreasonable rates. I even considered the idea of resting in a park for a couple of hours. Fortunately, we found a park and, by luck, secured a good spot to rest.

## A Journey Through Time and Thought

Around 10 o'clock, I ventured further into the city. The vibe was distinctly different; every city has its own unique atmosphere and surroundings. I noticed a couple of statues at the crossroads, and the city was remarkably neat and clean. The weather was fantastic. Someone mentioned that it usually rains heavily in the evenings, but today was an exception.

Finally, we arrived at the Mysore Palace, situated in the heart of the city. This palace used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. Entry tickets cost 100 rupees each. Upon entering, we saw a temple near the gate, but we decided not to visit it immediately since we had just eaten. The palace's exterior reminded me a bit of Lucknow University buildings—just a little joke!

We reached the counter to deposit our slippers, which cost 20 rupees for two pairs. As I finally entered the palace, I was amazed by the magnificent interior. The architecture was stunning, and I marveled at the grandeur. Construction started in 1897, making the building over 100 years old, yet it still shines brightly. Reports state that the current valuation of the building is around Rs 3,136.32 crores. Touching the walls is restricted, as they are adorned with intricate paintings and designs.

Seeing all this filled me with dopamine. Observing the craftsmanship from the last century made me think: if they were so advanced in arts, architecture, and painting back then, why don't more people today pursue new skills? It's not necessary to chase dreams or goals solely for success; learning new skills, regardless of age or public opinion, is important for personal growth. Whether it's dancing, music, or any other passion, we shouldn't care about what others think. Nowadays, everything is virtually connected, but we mustn't forget reality. We understand reality, but often lack self-control over it.

Okay, moving on—maybe I shared a bit too much wisdom there! Hahaha.

## An Encounter the police situation

After leaving the palace, Chamundi Hills were clearly visible in the distance, about 13 km away. I decided to head there. However, at a crossroad, a policeman stopped us because Deepak didn't have a helmet. The policeman instructed Deepak to get off the bike and took his place. Deepak quietly suggested giving the officer 100 rupees, but the policeman heard him. Somehow, I managed to handle the situation. Despite Deepak's panic, I remained confident that nothing serious would happen. I had been anticipating this moment, eager to show my complete set of vehicle documents and insurance.

The policeman asked for a fine for not wearing a helmet. Suddenly, an idea struck me. I told the officer that someone had stolen our helmet from the palace parking area and we were on our way to buy a new one. The policeman let us off with a warning, advising us not to use this excuse again. It was a strange situation for me, as it was my first encounter with the police in Karnataka. Nevertheless, it was an experience.

We bought a new helmet and headed for Chamundi Hills. Upon reaching the entry point, a duty policeman informed us that two-wheelers were not allowed on the hill. He suggested taking a government bus if we still wanted to go. We decided not to go. Although we missed Chamundi Hills, the experience was memorable. This trip reaffirmed that the real adventure lies in the journey, not just the destination.

## The Decision to Return

It was around 4 o'clock when I opened Google Maps to search for other places to visit. Deepak's health was deteriorating; his fever was increasing, yet he was still eager to explore the dam and the Railway Museum. However, I prioritized his well-being and finally decided that we should return to Bangalore.

## The Unexpected Challenges of the Return Journey

Our return journey began, this time taking a different route. We were exhausted from the lack of sleep and the long trip. In the midst of our journey, my new phone, which I was using for Google Maps, fell off the bike. Deepak's phone had only 1% charge remaining, making the situation even more frustrating. Despite trying, his phone wouldn't charge from my bike.

Without a functioning phone, we managed to travel 50 km, passing through various villages in Karnataka. Though I had seen villages in my hometown, experiencing these new ones was entirely different. It made me think of my office colleagues and their native places.

We stopped at a restaurant that looked like a dhaba, where Deepak could charge his phone. I was shocked by the menu prices: 40 rupees for an egg, 35 rupees for a roti, and 60 rupees for egg bhurji. It felt like we were being overcharged, but we accepted it as part of the experience.

## The Beauty of Unexplored Spots

I saw many fellow trip enthusiasts along the way, riding their bikes alone or in pairs. One place, in particular, caught my eye: on one side, there was a hill, and on the other, a stunning lake with bamboo-like trees swaying in the windy surroundings. It was breathtaking, and I couldn't help but wish I were there with my old friends. The scene was so beautiful that it surpassed any romantic relationship—more captivating than your girlfriend or boyfriend, dear reader. Hahaha!

## A Rainy Finale

We decided to continue our journey, and suddenly, heavy rain started pouring down. We embraced the situation, enjoying the surroundings, nature, and even our frustrations washed away by the rain. Finally, we reached our building, but not before stopping at a mobile shop to repair my phone. The repair guy was in luck—he got to fix a phone that was only four days old.

## The Unforgettable Experience

Overall, I missed mentioning many things in this particular blog. The experience was truly awesome. I would say: "Blue... the outdoors can lift you." I hope to be there again in the future, soon.
