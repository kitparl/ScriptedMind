This was my second trip, and it was special because sometimes sudden plans are better than the organized ones.

## The Sudden Adventure Starts

Here’s what happened: It was Saturday night, and I was hanging out with my friends from the building. We went to Mr. Professor’s shop and ate yummy Maggie and rice. When we were done, it was 2 o’clock in the morning. I wasn’t sure if I should go to Mysore or not. My bike was ready, but I couldn’t decide.

Finally, I decided to go. While I was packing my bag, I saw we only had one helmet. Unlike Lucknow, where you can ride with just one helmet, we needed another one. So, we decided to buy one on the way. I picked Dipak as my travel buddy. Even though Dipak had a fever, he was still really excited to come with me.

## The Enchantment of Hills on the Mysore Expressway

We started our trip, and I drove along the Mysore Expressway. As we traveled, I saw many small hills, and for some reason, I felt a deep sense of happiness upon seeing them. Being a mountain guy at heart, I had been confined to my room and office in Bangalore for the past year. These hills were mesmerizing me. In this fleeting life, where we never know how long we have or what the future holds, the hills seemed to be whispering, "Why are you missing out on beauty, my dear?" I found myself in a different mental space, pondering why these hills seemed to be speaking to me, whether it was my imagination or something more. Regardless, the feelings I experienced from the hills felt profoundly genuine.

## Magic of Hills on the Highway

We began our trip, and I drove on the Mysore Expressway. As we went along, I saw lots of small hills, and they made me feel very happy. I love mountains, but in Bangalore, I had only been stuck in my room and office for a year. These hills were so beautiful. In this short life, where we don’t know what will happen next, the hills felt like they were saying, "Why are you missing out on such beauty?" I started thinking about why the hills seemed to be talking to me, whether it was just my imagination or something else. But whatever it was, the feelings I had from the hills felt very real.

## A Quest for Rest

We finally got to Mysore at 5 o’clock. We needed to find a place to stay for 3-4 hours. I looked for a dharamshala, thinking it would be like the ones in North India, where travelers can stay for free or for a small amount. These places used to be common for people on long trips.

We found a place called a dharamshala, but it was empty. A local told us that dharamshalas are not common here. We then looked for hotels, but they were too expensive. I even thought about resting in a park for a few hours. Luckily, we found a park and got a nice spot to rest.

## A Trip Through Time and Thoughts

Around 10 o'clock, I went deeper into the city. It felt different; each city has its own special vibe. I saw some statues at the crossroads, and the city was very clean. The weather was great, and even though it usually rains a lot in the evenings, today it didn’t.

We finally reached the Mysore Palace, right in the middle of the city. This palace used to be the home of the Wadiyar dynasty and the center of the Kingdom of Mysore. Tickets cost 100 rupees each. We saw a temple near the entrance but decided to skip it for now since we had just eaten. The outside of the palace reminded me a bit of Lucknow University buildings—just a little joke!

We went to the counter to leave our slippers, which cost 20 rupees for two pairs. When we went inside the palace, I was amazed by how beautiful it was. The design was stunning, and it was built over 100 years ago, in 1897, but still looks impressive. The palace is now worth about Rs 3,136.32 crores. We weren’t allowed to touch the walls because they are decorated with detailed paintings and designs.

Seeing all this made me very happy. It made me think: if people back then could do such amazing art and architecture, why don’t more people today try to learn new skills? It’s not just about achieving success; learning new things, no matter your age or what others think, helps you grow. Whether it’s dancing, music, or anything else, we shouldn’t worry about others’ opinions. Even though everything is connected online today, we shouldn’t forget real life. We understand reality, but often struggle to control it.

Okay, moving on—maybe I shared a bit too much wisdom there! Hahaha.

## A Run-In with the Police

After leaving the palace, we could see Chamundi Hills about 13 km away, so I decided to go there. But at a crossroad, a policeman stopped us because Deepak didn’t have a helmet. The policeman told Deepak to get off the bike and took his place. Deepak nervously suggested giving the officer 100 rupees, but the policeman heard him. I managed to handle the situation calmly. Even though Deepak was worried, I was confident that everything would be fine. I was ready to show all my vehicle documents and insurance.

The policeman asked for a fine because of the missing helmet. Then I had an idea. I told the officer that someone had stolen our helmet from the palace parking area and we were going to buy a new one. The policeman let us go with just a warning and told us not to use this excuse again. This was my first time dealing with the police in Karnataka, so it was a new experience for me.

We bought a new helmet and went to Chamundi Hills. When we got there, a policeman told us that two-wheelers weren’t allowed on the hill. He suggested taking a government bus if we wanted to go. We decided not to go. Even though we missed visiting Chamundi Hills, the trip was still memorable. It reminded me that the real adventure is in the journey, not just reaching the destination.

## The Decision to Return

At around 4 o'clock, I checked Google Maps to find other places to visit. Deepak wasn’t feeling well; his fever was getting worse, but he still wanted to see the dam and the Railway Museum. I decided that his health was more important, so we agreed to go back to Bangalore.

## Problems on the Way Back

We started our return trip on a different route. We were very tired from not sleeping and the long journey. During the trip, my new phone, which I was using for Google Maps, fell off the bike. Deepak’s phone was almost out of battery, and it wouldn’t charge from my bike.

Without working phones, we traveled 50 km through different villages in Karnataka. I had seen villages before, but these were new to me. It made me think about my office friends and where they come from.

We stopped at a restaurant that looked like a dhaba, so Deepak could charge his phone. I was surprised by the menu prices: 40 rupees for an egg, 35 rupees for a roti, and 60 rupees for egg bhurji. It felt like we were paying too much, but we accepted it as part of the adventure.

## The Beauty of Unexplored Spot

On our way back, I saw many people on their bikes, riding alone or with a friend. One spot really caught my attention: there was a hill on one side and a beautiful lake on the other, with bamboo-like trees swaying in the wind. It was so stunning that I wished I could share it with my old friends. The view was so amazing, it felt even more special than any romantic relationship—more captivating than a girlfriend or boyfriend, just for fun! Hahaha!

## A Rainy End

We decided to keep going, and then it started raining heavily. We enjoyed the rain, letting it wash away our frustrations and adding to the adventure. When we finally got back to our building, we stopped at a mobile shop to get my phone repaired. The repair guy was happy to fix a phone that was only four days old.

## The Unforgettable Experience

I know I missed sharing a lot in this blog, but the trip was amazing. I’d say, “Blue... the outdoors can really lift your spirits.” I hope I can experience it all again soon.
