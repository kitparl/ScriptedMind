This poem is very special to me. I wrote it on **_April 28, 2021_**. While it may not be extraordinary, it holds deep meaning. I'm sharing it with you just because it feels personal. It's also my first attempt at writing a poem.

# Stronger Together

**My sun rises from your exquisite eyes.**\
**You know what's my heart's price.**\
**Yes, no one can afford,**\
**Because you are my beauty-wise.**

**How did God create your captivating smile?**\
**We met, It's been a long while.**\
**Doesn't matter... because**\
**I believe my love will never projectile.**

**Never cry or be sad, please,**\
**Indulge my menacing tease.**\
**Sure, one day I will make our new world,**\
**Where everything feels like a love breeze.**

**You always make my day.**\
**You know that day when we met—it was Sunday.**\
**Your umpteen love and everything,**\
**I can't seriously repay.**

**Sweetie, you’re my robust.**\
**I’m impressed with your loyalty, honesty, and trust.**\
**Believe me, you’re my enchanter because**\
**You made me stronger, like iron crust.**

**Post-haste, soon days will come bright.**\
**Our life will be full of delight.**\
**I want to see your pulchritudinous face daily,**\
**When my eyes close before my good night.**
