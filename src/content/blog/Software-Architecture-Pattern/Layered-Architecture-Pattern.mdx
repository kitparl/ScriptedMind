  Layered architecture is important because it provides a robust framework for
  building software that is modular, maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to
  change. It allows developers to manage complexity effectively while ensuring
  the system remains flexible and easy to maintain over time.

title: Layered Architecture Pattern
---

Layered architecture is a way of organizing software into separate levels, or _layers_, where each layer has a specific role or responsibility.

Let's break it down in simple terms

**1. Presentation Layer**

- This is like the **_face_** of application
- What users see and interact with
- Examples: buttons, screens, forms

**2. Business Layer**

- This is the **_brain_** of your application
- Contains all the rules about how things should work
- Example: calculating total price with tax in a shopping app

**3. Persistence Layer**

- This is like a translator between app and the database
- Handles how data is saved and loaded
- Example: converting user information into a format that can be saved

**4. Database Layer**

- This is like a filing cabinet where all data is stored
- Actual storage of information
- Example: storing user accounts, products, orders

## Important Feature

**Two-Way Traffic:** Information typically flows from top to bottom vice versa, like flight from Bengaluru to Lucknow and Lucknow to Bengaluru

**Independence:** Each layer can be changed without affecting others.

**Organization:** Similar things stay together (like keeping all UI elements in the presentation layer)

## When to Use This Pattern

- Perfect for simple applications.
- Good for small user bases (less than 200 users).
- Great for projects where requirements won't change much.
- Ideal for learning and starting out.

## Limitations

**Speed:** Like taking stairs in a tall building, requests must go through each layer, which can be slow.

**Changes:** Like moving furniture in a full room, making changes can be tricky.

**Updates:** If you change one layer, you usually need to redeploy the whole application.
