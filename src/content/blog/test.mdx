On my fourth ride, I encountered a man whose eyes lit up when he saw my bike. He mentioned that it was his dream bike, and I felt a surge of pride for my “kitpu” (my dirt bike). I affectionately patted its metal tank, appreciating its significance. He worked at a TVS showroom and shared some insights and opinions about South Indian people.
