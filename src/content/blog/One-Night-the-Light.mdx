Today, April 21, 2025, I gazed at the moon from the terrace, lost in deep thought, and expressed it in rhyme.

## One Night, the Light

**The moon glows bright,**\
**But where is my height?**

_(Am I rising? Or simply standing still beneath its light?)_

**Each time I fight,**\
**Yet I find no light.**

_(Struggles bloom like endless night, with no reward in sight.)_

**Sometimes life bites,**\
**Fell so hard, I become tight.**

_(Pain built walls where hope once grew now I feel nothing, passing through.)_

**Each day when I watch the kites in flight,**\
**I’ll grasp that dream, hold it might.**

_(New visions spark, a shift begins struggles don’t mean life can’t win.)_

**Again, I saw that guiding light,**\
**In the quiet hush of night.**

_(It whispered: “Even pain has role resistance builds the strongest soul.”)_

**I think I see with wiser sight,**\
**That glow was only borrowed light.**

_(If I can see the mirrored gleam, perhaps I know what life might mean.)_

**Is life a rite, a sacred flight?**\
**One day, all will turn to light.**

_(Nothing stays, no pain, no fear each dusk departs, and dawn draws near.)_
